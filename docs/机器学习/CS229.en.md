This course is also taught by Andrew Ng, but is a graduate course, so it pays more attention to mathematical theory. Those who are not satisfied with the using package and want to understand the essence of the algorithm in depth, or aspire to engage in machine learning research can take this course. All the course notes are available on the course website, written in a very professional and theoretical way, requiring sufficient mathematical foudation.
